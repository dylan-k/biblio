    11th, we will all gather to bask in their wordy glow one last time.
    For ten minutes without the obstruction of any ads. But first we
    will meet at The Blue Room of The Crown and enjoy three minute
    readings from many of the project's featured writers. LED haiku with

- abstract: \"Kite\" is a collaborative poem created as part of the
    Baltimore Ekphrasis Project, where sixty-six Baltimore-area writers
    and artists paired to inspire one another's work. This poem reflects
    on themes of freedom and constraint, using the imagery of a kite to
    symbolize the tension between aspirations and reality. The haiku was
    displayed on the LED Baltimore Art Billboard and published in full
    The Light Ekphrastic, alongside visual art created by collaborating
    artist Jared T. Fischer. The project as a whole aimed to explore the
    dynamic interplay between text and image in public spaces.

    drawings from artist Madison Smartt Bell. The anthology showcases
    the diversity of Baltimore's literary voices, offering a meditative
    counterpoint to the urban landscape in which they were displayed.

    delivered onto LED Baltimore 48 haikus. Will displayed them
    beautifully on top of enso drawings by Madison Smartt Bell. Now they
    are shining bright and colorful for everyone to see. On December
    11th, we will all gather to bask in their wordy glow one last time.
    For ten minutes without the obstruction of any ads. But first we
    will meet at The Blue Room of The Crown and enjoy three minute
    readings from many of the project's featured writers. LED haiku with
    Jen Michalski, Michael Kimball, Cort Bledsoe, Dave K., Tim Paggi, RM

    words. You can add, subtract, rearrange the sounds in very much the
    same way that you can on the page. With sound there are additional
    ways to edit. You can revise the speed, pitch, volume, echo and
    decay. This prompted me to title the album \\_Strange Punctuation\\_.
