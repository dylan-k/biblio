    "Editing recorded words is very much like editing written words. You can
    add, subtract, rearrange the sounds in very much the same way that you can
    on the page. With sound there are additional ways to edit. You can revise
    the speed, pitch, volume, echo and decay. This prompted me to title the
    album \"Strange Punctuation.\"\n\nreleased 05 August 2009 \nDylan Kinnett:
    \nall performance except as noted, production \n\nCurt Seiss: \nart
