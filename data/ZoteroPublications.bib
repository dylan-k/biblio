This study places Ukrainian Futurism within the context of other major Ukrainian literary movements of the time and examines its relationship to Russian and West European Futurism; it also includes critical analyses of the major works of the leading figures within the Ukrainian movement.},

In the tradition of the phonetic poems of Hugo Ball and the "readymades" of Dada, this exploration of the nature of verse straddles the line between form and nonsense, between intention and happy accident. An apostrophe is a poetic figure of speech in which a person, abstraction, or entity is addressed as if it were present; it is also the name of a 1993 poem in which every line is an apostrophe. This project, in which an internet search engine innovatively employs the lines of the 1993 poem as starting points for searches, allows the poem to expand and continue infinitely. The search engine is rigid but indiscriminant, and words and phrases that might not otherwise meet collide and carom away in an unpredictable manner. By turns poignant and banal, the resulting poems are challenging and relevant to a world of increased technological input and intrusion.

In a time when many are questioning if we still need formalism and feminism, Wertheim's +{\textbar}'me'S-pace is a spirited and fun defense of both. Written in part as a didactic instructional manual that cannot keep itself from constantly going astray into beautiful and challenging language play, this is a book that asks crucial questions and reconfigures recent histories. It is essential for its arguments. --Juliana SpahrIn +{\textbar}'me S-pace Christine Wertheim conceives of our language as prey to negation; with everyone struggling to define their-selves through difference, where instead one might be better off with a wholly inclusive body in mind; with every one of us as merely mobile, as modular. --The Brooklyn Rail
Product Description
+{\textbar}'me'S-pace is book 1, volume 2 of a wider, ongoing project into the current state of the English tongue. In making its investigations, the project employs a method known as litteral poetics, in which words are not taken as arbitrary signs the writer may use as s/he sees fit, but as compounds with substance and structures and, literally, meanings of their own. The method begins by isolating arrangements of the tongue that seem most categorical, proceeds to investigating the combinations and permutations within these strings, and finishes by presenting noteworthy arrangements to the reader s e{\textbar}e and ear. +I'me'S-pace is published as part of the TrenchArt: Casements Series, with an introduction by Dodie Bellamy and art by Lisa Darms.},

In our explorations, we cast a wide net for what to include under the rubric of conceptual writing: appropriation, sampling, piracy, flarf, erasure, constraint, identity theft, etc.  Conceptual writing, in fact, might be better defined not by the strategies used but by the expectations of the readership or thinkership received.

In Cage's work in theatre composition there is a blurring of the distinctions between music, dance, literature, art and everyday life. Here, William Fetterman examines the majority of those compositions by Cage which are audial as well as visual in content, beginning with his first work in this genre in 1952, and continuing through 1992.Much of the information in this study comes from previously undocumented material discovered among the unpublished scores and notes of Cage and his frequent collaborator David Tudor, as well as author's interviews with Cage and with individuals closely associated with his work, including David Tudor, Merce Cunningham, Bonnie Bird, Mary Caroline Richards, and Ellsworth Snyder.},

	abstract = {In The Gutenberg Elegies, nationally renowned critic Sven Birkerts powerfully argues that we are living in a state of intellectual emergency - an emergency caused by our willingness to embrace new technologies at the expense of the printed word. As we rush to get "on line," as we make the transition from book to screen, says Birkerts, we are turning against some of the core premises of humanism - indeed, we are putting the idea of individualism itself under threat. The printed page and the circuit driven information technologies are not kindred - for Birkerts they represent fundamentally opposed forces. In their inevitable confrontation our deepest values will be tested. Birkerts begins his exploration from the reader's perspective, first in several highly personal accounts of his own passion for the book, then in a suite of essays that examines what he calls "the ulterior life of reading." Against this, Birkerts sets out the contours of the transformed landscape. In his highly provocative essay "Into the Electronic Millennium" and in meditations on CD-ROM, hypertext, and audio books, he plumbs the impact of emerging technologies on the once stable reader-writer exchange. He follows these with a look at the changing climate of criticism and literary practice. He concludes with a blistering indictment of what he sees as our willingness to strike a Faustian pact with a seductive devil.},

Instead, he relates the rise of a capitalist economy to the Puritan determination to work out anxiety over salvation or damnation by performing good deeds — an effort that ultimately discouraged belief in predestination and encouraged capitalism. Weber's classic study has long been required reading in college and advanced high school social studies classrooms.},

	shorttitle = {Hamlet on the {Holodeck}},
	abstract = {Stories define how we think, the way we play, and the way we understand our lives. And just as Gutenberg made possible the stories that ushered in the Modem Era, so is the computer having a profound effect on the stories of the late 20th century. Today we are confronting the limits of books themselves -- anticipating the end of storytelling as we know it -- even as we witness the advent of a brave new world of cyberdramas. Computer technology of the late twentieth century is astonishing, thrilling, and strange, and no one is better qualified than Janet Murray to offer a breathtaking tour of how it is reshaping the stories we live by. Can we imagine a world in which Homer's "Iyre" and Gutenberg's press have given way to virtual reality environments like the "Star Trek" ® holodeck? Murray sees the harbingers of such a world in the fiction of Borges and Calvino, movies like "Groundhog Day," and the videogames and Web sites of the 1990s. Where is our map for this new frontier, and what can we hope to find in it? What will it be like to step into our own stories for the first time, to change our vantage point at will, to construct our own worlds or change the outcome of a compelling adventure, be it a murder mystery or a torrid romance? Taking up where Marshall McLuhan left off, Murray offers profound and provocative answers to these and other questions. She discusses the unique properties and pleasures of digital environments and connects them with the traditional satisfactions of narrative. She analyzes the state of "immersion, " of participating in a text to such an extent that you literally get lost in a story and obliterate the outside world from your awareness. Shedissects the titillating effect of cyber-narratives in which stories never climax and never end, because everything is morphable, and there are always infinite possibilities for the next scene. And she introduces us to enchanted landscapes populated by witty automated characters and inventive role-playing interactors, who together make up a new kind of "commedia dell'arte." Equal parts daydream and how-to, "Hamlet on the Holodeck" is a brilliant blend of imagination and techno-wizardry that will provoke readers and guide writers for years to come.},

In hypermedia, Landow saw in a strikingly literal embodiment of many major points of contemporary literary theory, particularly Derrida's idea of "de-centering" and Barthes's conception of the "readerly" versus "writerly" text. "Landow['s]... presentation is measured, experiential, lucid, moderate, and sensible. He merely points out that the concept 'hypertext' lets us test some concepts associated with critical theory, and gracefully shows how the technology is contributing to reconfigurations of text, author, narrative, and (literary) education." -- Post Modern Culture, reviewing the first edition},

Ara Shirinyan gives us an early glimpse at the deadening effects of globalization on language. Collapsing the space between the 'real world' and the World Wide Web, this book calls into question: What is local? What is national? What is multicultural? Instead of accepting current notions of language as a medium of differentiation, Shirinyan persuasively demonstrates its leveling quality, demolishing meaning into a puddle of platitudes. In a time when everything is great, yet nothing is great, you can almost hear Andy Warhol the king of blandness and neutrality saying, Gee, this book is great. -Kenneth Goldsmith},

	annote = {Product Description
Poetry. READING THE REMOVE OF LITERATURE is a reading of Maurice Blanchot's seminal book The Space of Literature, performed on the page as an annotative writing that encircles the should-be space of print. Through the progressive appropriation and then erasure of Blanchot's text, and through a processual transposition of hand-writing into formal typography, Thurston addresses the very question of the possibility of literature that obsessed Blanchot. The meaning of the candid reflections and meditations which form the incisive marginalia is founded in a tension with the suggestions of the absent text. Floating alone these annotations may have little worth or make little sense, but between these covers they do not deny the history of their derivation: They are constantly anchored by that which is missing, in a creative erring, in a process of over-coming, which in this book asserts an equality of presence between the read and the written; the reading and the writing.

	year = {2003},
	annote = {From Publishers Weekly
Following up on her 2000 debut Juice (Kelsey Street), Gladman here pushes West Coast "new narrative" further into Kafka- and Poindexter-esque territory. A form of elliptical prose taken up in the '90s by writers like Dodie Bellamy, Mary Burger, Laura Moriarty and Camille Roy (and adapted by Gladman's peers Pamela Lu and Lytle Shaw), new narrative allows the basic elements of novels (plot, character, dialogue, specificity of setting) to run through the text without being sketched all the way in. By turns noirish first-person memoir and journalistic satire, The Activist depicts the goings on of a cell or affinity group that may or may not have blown up a bridge that may or may not have existed. Descriptions are inflected such that the names of characters (Lomarlo, Monique), their relations to each other (often same sex) and the way they talk ("This our downtown"; the title itself may be in the plural) put pressure on categories of race, gender and sexual orientation. The group may also have developed technology for emptying the memories of subjects, and controlling them Matrix-style, and their prevarications have a Godardian intellectualized haplessness. Yet the memory technology sets up the most powerful of the book's 10 sections, "The State," where it is unclear if the first-person narrator is being held by the government or by the activists, for what reason and to what purpose. The book works best as one of the first full-length mirrors held to the post 9/11 U.S.; in its targeting and rhetoric; it is something less than allegorical, more than a little chilling, and often very beautiful.

Product Description
Fiction. African American Studies. Straddling fiction and poetry, Renee Gladman's writing operates on the level of the sentence, constructing suprise and oblique meanings at every turn, and somehow managing the supremely difficult trick of both engaging and pushing the reader. "THE ACTIVIST begins in the middle of a revolution....There is a bridge that may or may not have been bombed. People speak in nonsense and cannot stop themselves. In the mids of all this, the language of news reports mixes with the language of confession. The art of this beautifully written book is in how it touchingly illustrates that relations between humans and cities are linked in a more complex interface than most realize"--Juliana Spahr.},

From Publishers Weekly
Shaw's book-length poem--part faux-documentary, part pastoral meditation on landscapes both mental and post-industrial, and also something of a novel--spins centrifugally from an investigation of the conceptual artist Robert Smithson, best known for his Spiral Jetty, an "earthwork" that extends into Utah's Great Salt Lake. Cable Factory 20 is an oblique homage to the artist and his work, imaginatively reconstructing Smithson's idiosyncratic topics, methods of site-specific research (from 20 vantage points) and the post-humanist, near ascetic set of values he took into artistic creation. In Shaw's Bay Area, the debris of industry forces the attentive speaker to alter his perceptions of time and space--matching the city-in-history's non-anthropomorphic scale: "Each city is actually a twin/ with the city of 'Environs,' where/ motion propels into a phrase/ universe whose quality of surrounding / allows suffixes, abrasion./ And from here, the twin evils:/ (disbelief in substance,/ the body as final container)/ appear as so many programmatic/ whiffs." The book's pages become archeological sites unto themselves; each is bordered with Smithson-related images purposefully degraded via repeated photocopying, and repeating in patterns that emphasize the historical "trace" that corrupts as it transforms and decays. Developing most conspicuously the careful rhythms of Barrett Watten and Lyn Hejinian, Shaw nonetheless occasionally takes on more familiar tones, breaking in as a "narrator" with pellucid facts and cryptic commentary as he finds things and discards them, makes time to spend and time to lose, has fortuitous encounters, unforeseen set-backs, and so on. The cumulative effect has all the essential essences of noir, but stripped of plot and narrative--like meeting Welles' "third man" over and over again. This is one of the most intriguing books of the new year, and certainly a terrific first book. (Jan.) Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.
Product Description
Poetry. "The water shored up the pilings and barnacles/ that shored up the pier, that shored up/ the memory machine." In Lytle Shaw's CABLE FACTORY 20, Robert Smithson's description of the landscape surrounding his Spiral Jetty in Utah's Great Salt Lake guides 20 site-specific poems. In the spirit of Smithson's site/ non-site dynamic, which proposes a continuous circuit between objects selected for framing as art and the contexts out of which they have been pulled. Shaw uses the San Francisco Bay Area as his laboratory, exploring the extent to which a poetics of place, a linguistic site-specificity, is possible in the social/architectural landscape of turn of the century America.

His experiments in criticism consist of rewriting old, existing critical texts, changing them as little as possible while making them pertinent to new subjects. In his own words, the "somewhat scandalous methodology" involves "the creation of criticism through the strict recreation of an earlier critic's text (or, more precisely, through as strict a re-creation as the discrepancy between my source text and chosen topic would allow). Thus, my "Short History of Language Poetry" follows the arguments (and even wording) of Jean Wahl's A Short History of Existentialism, while "The Literati of San Francisco" takes Edgar Allan Poe's Literati of New York City as its template." The interesting thing about this experimental method of criticism is this: it takes our usual ways of looking at these subjects and makes them new. Our familiar sense of the poets in question is changed when we see them through different lenses. In a way, Friedlander is only doing for criticism what so many intertextual poets, from Eliot through the Oulipo and beyond, have done for poetry. If you're up for some odd, provocative ideas, check this out. If you want to read more about Friedlander's method, check out Avant-Post, a book edited by Louis Armand. It appears in July of '06.},

The careful tonal variations of Farrell's Thimking of You were followed by 1999's Last Instance, a magnificent book of prose poems honing in on linguistic aggregations and displacements of all sorts via wry wit and skewed observations of the social-psychological crossroads of capital. This third book takes a step further into involuntary I-driven collusion, using Rorschach tests to show that the visual imagination, fetishized by psychoanalysis as a royal road to the unconscious, is more socially than pathologically produced. Meticulously culling (and perhaps editing) actual subject responses from a variety of medical texts, Farrell arranges them alphabetically and simply lets them do their work without further interference. The result is astonishing: in the same way that the subjects create what they see from ambiguous images, so do readers of this book conjure the subjects themselves, calibrating similarities and differences among responses. Yet as the sheer number of descriptions begins to pile up, the images themselves seem to come into view, and the subjects begin to amalgamate in an imaginative implosion: "An existential crab. An explosive center, forms floating around the calm after the storm.... An underwater tea scene. An unreal carnival-like Halloween party, shoes like cloven hoofs, bodies bent. An x-ray of alimentary canal, double heart, spinal column and feces. An x-ray of somebody's spinal cord. And a butterfly." The strange tensions of the subjects, and the blank abyss of the implied interlocutors, further add to the spooky beauty, while the zeitgeists of the eras in which the tests were conducted (Farrell lists his sources, ranging from the 1940s to the 1980s) also come through clearly, with a particular emphasis on scientific discourse as a source of cultural authority. As with Kenneth Goldsmith's No. 111 and Jackson Mac Low's aleatory work, it is the simultaneity of all these strands that makes this unparagraphed, beautifully printed and bound text a poem, one whose meanings and sound plays are impossible to exhaust.

	title = {{CONCEPTUAL} {WRITING} {AND} {ITS} {OTHERS}},
	abstract = {‘I will refer to the kind of art in which I am involved as conceptual art. In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art. (my italics) This kind of art is not theoretical or illustrative of theories; it is intuitive, it is involved with all types of mental processes and it is purposeless. It is usually free from the dependence on the skill of the artist as a craftsman. It is the objective of the artist who is concerned with conceptual art to make his work mentally interesting to the spectator, and therefore usually he would want it to become emotionally dry. There is no reason to suppose, however, that the conceptual artist is out to bore the viewer. It is only the expectation of an emotional kick, to which one conditioned to expressionist art is accustomed, that would deter the viewer from perceiving this art.’ Sol LeWitt, ‘Paragraphs on Conceptual Art,’ Artforum, June 1967.

‘Conceptual Writing’, as recently described by Kenneth Goldsmith and Craig Dworkin, recalls, returns us to, such classic texts as Le Witt’s above. Here I would like to broaden the formal base of a putative conceptual writing practice, by drawing out some more comparisons between Conceptual art and Language writing. As a starting point, here are some remarks from Liz Kotz’s admirable new book, Words to be looked at, Language in 1960s art:

‘If , as Roslind Krauss has argued, the breakdown of medium-based practices provides one model of a historical shift from ‘specific’ to ‘general’ forms of art, another logic is at play right alongside it, in which a ‘general’ template or notational system,--be it musical scores, fabrication instructions, architectural blueprints or diagrams, or schematic representations—generates ‘specific’ realisations in different contexts.’

What Kotz calls the ‘general template’ is what here, in the promulgations of Conceptual writing, following on from Duchamp/LeWitt, is called ‘the idea’, ‘the concept’ or the ‘machine’ and what I propose to call the ‘pretext’ for writing. The pre-text, is what Ouipians call the ‘constraint’ and it corresponds to the texts, explicit or implicit, that identify specific proceduralist practices associated with Language writing. Among the most programmatically explicit of such pre-texts are those that precede selections of Jackson MacLow’s various ‘genres’ –the ‘asymetries’, the ‘gathas’ , the ‘pronouns’. Ron Silliman long ago acknowledged the force of MacLow’s example for his own practice:

‘if I trace the movement towards such devices in my own writing what I find is a recognition, gained in stages over a period of years, that what was truly subversive, in the literal and best sense, about Jackson MacLow’s chance methodology was not the use of chance … but the turn toward method itself. … it took the artificial surface texture of the chance-composed text, with all its rigid awkwardness, to make that turn to method apparent.’ The Difficulties, Interview with Tom Beckett, 1985.

Bernadette Mayer’s ‘Experiments’ and Charles Bernstein’s subsequent additions, should also be as pre-texts.

‘Appropriation’ is another ‘general template’, one privileged by the self-branded Conceptualists, but one in which each specific realisation appears to have an equally specific pretext. It’s a template whose various framings and croppings, however, point to a strategic generality. Or better put, pre-texts provide the con-text for the specific realisations. Other works with comparably specific pretexts include Cage’s ‘writings-through’ of Thoreau, or MacLow’s of Pound, and obviously translations.

Because it is often implicit and sometimes a mere formula, the notion that the pretext provides the context for the specific realisations, maybe less than evident. Similarly, the assertion that the idea, or pretext, is more interesting that its application, maybe unconvincing. Does the Oulipian constraint N+7, or the 1,1,2,3,5,8, 13, 21 Fibonacci series that structures Tjanting and some sections of Lit, make the grade as a text? What of Lawrence Weiner’s ‘statement of intent’? “1) The artist may construct the work 2) The work may be fabricated 3) The work need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.” This statement has served as the general template for all of Weiner’s work since its first publication in 1968. Further each specific work is a secondary general template whose linguistic form may result in specific realisations as a result of its reception. Mostly they remain as text on a page or a gallery wall, but specific realisations have been undertaken by the artist or by ‘receivers’ For an exhibition at the Bern Kunsthalle in 1983, twelve people were invited to fabricate a work.

The devolution of authorship that was a feature of the intent, at least early on. of Language writers, insinuates a further realisation, a post-text. Weiner’s MANY COLOURED OBJECTS PLACED SIDE BY SIDE TO FORM A ROW OF MANY COLOURED OBJECTS placed on the walls of a gallery, in that context, might be fabricated by a curator as an exhibition of paintings, or by me as a shelf of books in my library. Similarly with MacLow’s The Pronouns, A Collection of Forty Dances for the Dancers, 1964, which includes MacLow’s ‘Some Remarks to the Dancers (How the Dances Are to be Performed \& How They Were Made),’ spelling out the elaborate chance operations he used to generate the specific realisations that are the poems making up the collection, poems which in turn serve as choreographic pre-texts to be translated into specific dances. In relation to the general template of ‘Some remarks’, the dances can be described as ‘post-texts.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The Literature of Exhaustion is an influential 1967 essay by american novelist John Barth, which is sometimes considered to be the manifesto of postmodernism.
The essay was highly influential,[1] and for some, controversial.[2] It depicted Literary realism as an “used up” tradition; Barth's description of his own work, which many though that nailed a core trait of postmodernism, is “novels which imitate the form of a novel, by an author who imitates the role of Author”.[3]
Barth argued that a particular stage in history was passing, and pointed to possible directions from there. He later (1980) wrote a follow-up essay, "The Literature of Replenishment."
[edit] Publications
Barth first delivered it in 1967 as a lecture in a Peters Rushton Seminars held at the University of Virginia;[4] then it was first printed in The Atlantic in the same year; since then has been reprinted several times, and included in Barth's non-fiction collection The Friday Book (1984).},
